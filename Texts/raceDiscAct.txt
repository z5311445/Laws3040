                     (b)  make unlawful any act done to give effect to such a provision.

9  Racial discrimination to be unlawful

             (1)  It is unlawful for a person to do any act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.

          (1A)  Where:

                     (a)  a person requires another person to comply with a term, condition or requirement which is not reasonable having regard to the circumstances of the case; and

                     (b)  the other person does not or cannot comply with the term, condition or requirement; and

                     (c)  the requirement to comply has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, by persons of the same race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin as the other person, of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life;

the act of requiring such compliance is to be treated, for the purposes of this Part, as an act involving a distinction based on, or an act done by reason of, the other person’s race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin.

             (2)  A reference in this section to a human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life includes any right of a kind referred to in Article 5 of the Convention.

             (3)  This section does not apply in respect of the employment, or an application for the employment, of a person on a ship or aircraft (not being an Australian ship or aircraft) if that person was engaged, or applied, for that employment outside Australia.

             (4)  The succeeding provisions of this Part do not limit the generality of this section.

10  Rights to equality before the law

             (1)  If, by reason of, or of a provision of, a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, persons of a particular race, colour or national or ethnic origin do not enjoy a right that is enjoyed by persons of another race, colour or national or ethnic origin, or enjoy a right to a more limited extent than persons of another race, colour or national or ethnic origin, then, notwithstanding anything in that law, persons of the first‑mentioned race, colour or national or ethnic origin shall, by force of this section, enjoy that right to the same extent as persons of that other race, colour or national or ethnic origin.

             (2)  A reference in subsection (1) to a right includes a reference to a right of a kind referred to in Article 5 of the Convention.

             (3)  Where a law contains a provision that:

                     (a)  authorizes property owned by an Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander to be managed by another person without the consent of the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander; or

                     (b)  prevents or restricts an Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander from terminating the management by another person of property owned by the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander;

not being a provision that applies to persons generally without regard to their race, colour or national or ethnic origin, that provision shall be deemed to be a provision in relation to which subsection (1) applies and a reference in that subsection to a right includes a reference to a right of a person to manage property owned by the person.

11  Access to places and facilities

                   It is unlawful for a person:

                     (a)  to refuse to allow another person access to or use of any place or vehicle that members of the public are, or a section of the public is, entitled or allowed to enter or use, or to refuse to allow another person access to or use of any such place or vehicle except on less favourable terms or conditions than those upon or subject to which he or she would otherwise allow access to or use of that place or vehicle;

                     (c)  to require another person to leave or cease to use any such place or vehicle or any such facilities;

             (3)  Nothing in this section renders unlawful an act in relation to accommodation in a dwelling‑house or flat, being accommodation shared or to be shared, in whole or in part, with the person who did the act or a person on whose behalf the act was done or with a relative of either of those persons.

                     (b)  to assist or promote whether by financial assistance or otherwise the doing of such an act.

18  Acts done for 2 or more reasons

                   Where:

                     (a)  an act is done for 2 or more reasons; and

                     (b)  one of the reasons is the race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin of a person (whether or not it is the dominant reason or a substantial reason for doing the act);

then, for the purposes of this Part, the act is taken to be done for that reason.

Note:          Subsection (1) makes certain acts unlawful. Section 46P of the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 allows people to make complaints to the Australian Human Rights Commission about unlawful acts. However, an unlawful act is not necessarily a criminal offence. Section 26 says that this Act does not make it an offence to do an act that is unlawful because of this Part, unless Part IV expressly says that the act is an offence.

                     (a)  in the performance, exhibition or distribution of an artistic work; or

                     (b)  in the course of any statement, publication, discussion or debate made or held for any genuine academic, artistic or scientific purpose or any other genuine purpose in the public interest; or

                     (c)  in making or publishing:

this Act applies in relation to the person as if the person had also done the act.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to an act done by an employee or agent of a person if it is established that the person took all reasonable steps to prevent the employee or agent from doing the act.

Part VII—Miscellaneous

  

44  Jurisdiction

             (1)  The several courts of the States are invested with federal jurisdiction, and jurisdiction is conferred on the several courts of the Territories, within the limits of their several jurisdictions, whether those limits are as to locality, subject‑matter or otherwise, to hear and determine civil and criminal proceedings instituted in those courts under this Act.

             (2)  No proceedings under this Act shall be instituted in a court of a State or Territory before a day to be fixed by Proclamation as the day on which:

                     (a)  that court shall commence to exercise its jurisdiction under subsection (1); or

                     (b)  a class of courts of that State or Territory in which that court is included shall commence to exercise their jurisdiction under that subsection;

but nothing in this subsection prevents a court from exercising jurisdiction in a matter arising under this Act in a proceeding instituted in that court otherwise than under this Act.

             (2)  If a submission has been made, a document or information has been given, or evidence has been given, to the Commission or the Commissioner, a person is not liable to an action, suit or other proceeding in respect of loss, damage or injury of any kind suffered by another person merely because submission was made, the document or information was furnished or the evidence was given.
